Notes
.....
 1. To test email addresses that include ASCII control characters (ASCII
    positions < 32), put a Unicode entity in this data. This is because XML
    doesn't like storing &#x00;. The Unicode entity you should use
    is &#x2400; + the ASCII position. E.g to test a BEL character (ASCII
    position 7), put a &#x2407; in this data. This also enables the control
    characters to be made visible in your output because the Unicode characters
    &#x2400; onwards are 'SYMBOL FOR xxx'. In other words &#x2407; will look
    like BEL in your output.

 2. Certain outcomes are impossible to test since they imply another, higher
    order, outcome also. These are:

    ISEMAIL_RFC5322_DOMLIT_OBSDTEXT
    This implies that the domain literal cannot be a valid RFC 5321 address
    literal. This issue outranks the fact that the token is also obs-dtext.

If you update these tests, don't forget to change the actual version number
attribute in the <tests> element below!
